# Shell Scripts I've written

- Each of these scripts is written for the purpose of automating processes I use or presume that it would make an inconvenience like initiating a python venv with proper gitignores and library management as well as updating my frequently updating iti log as well as ITI repo no matter where im standing

## update.sh
- a script for automating the process of updating the repo with the specific date of what ive learned on that day either its labs just hearing a lecture where they all are in [ITI](https://github.com/abdulrahmanalaa123/ITI-sessions) not really useful working on improving such a thing

## python env
- this is a script for simplifying the process of creating a python venv purposefully done to improve upon my bash skills as well as automating such a tedious task by simply prompting which maybe isnt the best user experience but i dont think in bash yet
- adding the options `-s` to the script would run silently and default in creating an environment with the name defaultenv
- you should probably add it to your aliases by typing `alias python_env='source path/to/python_env_setup.sh'` you should run it in source if you want to activate your current env on your current shell if not just simply run it normally and it would initiate the repo and create a gitignore file
